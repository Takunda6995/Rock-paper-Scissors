# Rock-paper-Scissors
Odin projection foundtion course javascript
the program is run in an external javascript file.
my idea was to create a working algorithm that prints the result to the console

start
Create arry of 3 string values
create variable x-increment wnen player round is finished , i- increment when user wins round, j-increment when computer wins round
do {
Prompt the user to enter  the his choice of 1-rock 2-paper 3-scissors
Store the input in a variable
Subtract the variable by 1 and store in the variable userinput
Use the maths class to generate  a number between 0 and 2 inclusive 
Make sure the number is and interget
Store the number generated in another  variable in the variabl comp input
if userinput is not equal to compinput then
 if userinput is greater than compinput 
 then increment i and print player wins round 
 else if userinput = 0 and compinput = 2    
 then increment j and print computer wins
 else if compinput =0 and user input =2 
 then increment i and prnt player wins
 else computer wins and increment j
 if i is 3 or j is 3 then exit the while loop
    increment x
else
don not increment x
)while(x less than 5)

if i is greater than j 
then print user wins 
esle print computer wins
